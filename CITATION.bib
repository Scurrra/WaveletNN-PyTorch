  annote = {Wavelets have found usage in signal processing and image analysis. They can extract important information from the signal, producing its approximation and details components both half the length of the original signal. Then the original signal can be reconstructed. Nevertheless, wavelet transform is not widely used in neural networks because of complications in implementation. We propose trainable PyTorch modules for wavelet transforms and loss functions which can be used for construction of specific wavelets.}
